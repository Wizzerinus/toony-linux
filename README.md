# Toony Linux (v0.2)

A minimalistic Linux launcher for Toontown Rewritten and Toontown: Corporate Clash.

# NOTE

This repository remains in place as an API reference for any future launcher developers. However, using
the launcher itself is not recommended, as it has caused weird thread problems (i.e. freezing
in OCLO and less commonly VP boss rounds) and weird network problems (i.e. false-positive VPN triggers)
for its users. In certain scenarios, the CLI also stops working if a window is launched, which renders
the launcher effectively useless.

## Configuration

* Copy `accounts.example.yaml` to `accounts.yml` and fill in your account details.
  (multiple toons are supported)
* Run the script
* If using Corporate Clash: Use `update clash` command to download the game
* If using Toontown Rewritten: Use `update rewritten` command to download the game
* Run `lc <toon1> <toon2>` (can have any number of space-separated different toons)

### Disclaimer: Password encryption

***Note from 08/11/2022:*** Toontown: Corporate Clash implemented the token system and deprecated
password logins, so this does not apply to the server. It still applies to Toontown Rewritten, though.
***

As most Toontown login servers do not support login systems using 
asymmetric encryption algorithms, the passwords have to be stored in plain text.
This is a security risk. You can override this by *not setting your password*, which
will allow you to type in password at login time. As this launcher is open-source, it's
easy enough to check that I do not do more with your passwords than it is required to log
in, however, damage can be caused by people other than you opening the `accounts.yml` file.

**I am not responsible** for any damage caused by the plaintext password interface.
**You have been warned.** If you want better security, do not set the password in the file and enter it at login.

## TODO

* Graphical interface
* Multicontroller capabilities
* OCR and combo recognition
